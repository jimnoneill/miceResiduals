Title: Multiple Imputation and Residual Integration for Restricted Cubic Splines
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Jamey", "ONeill", email = "jimnoneill@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides functionality for working with multiply imputed datasets in the 
    context of Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) modeling. This package addresses the 
    limitation that RCS models don't work directly on multiple datasets by providing 
    tools to pool datasets, extract and add model residuals back to imputed datasets, 
    and repack them into the proper MICE format. Originally developed for cannabis 
    exposure research published in environmental health literature, but applicable to 
    any multiple imputation workflow requiring residual integration. This is open 
    source software released under the MIT License to benefit the research community.
